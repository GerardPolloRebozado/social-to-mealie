USER_PROMPT="You will receive a transcription of a video generated by Whisper AI. This transcription may include timestampsâ€”please ignore them, as they are not needed for the Mealie recipe.

             You will also receive:
             - The video thumbnail from a social network, which should be used as the recipe cover.
             - A post description from the same social network, which may contain additional ingredient information.
             - The original post itself, which must be saved.

             Important:
             - Do **not** translate the recipe unless explicitly instructed.
             - Always keep the recipe in its **original language**.

             Your task is to process this content accordingly."
