# Social media to Mealie

Found any recipe on a social media and don't want to manually write it yourself? use our tool to import any video from them in Mealie.
For now only works with Instagram,TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest (without cover image) but will add more if you open an 
issue. 
Currently, some post may give BAD_RECIPE error, with is a mealie issue parsing the recipe, I have still not found why 
sometimes works and sometimes not.
The prompt can be customized in the ENV, so if you find a better one, please open an issue or PR.

## Deployment

To deploy this just use the docker-compose.yml and populate all the environment variables
